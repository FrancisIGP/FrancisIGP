## About me

Hey there! Welcome to my github page. My name is Francis, and I am dedicated to developing a future in networking and cybersecurity, generally in the cyber world; I'm goal-driven, working hard to fulfill my ambitions. I'm currently a high school student, and as a 
leisure, I'm dedicated on expanding my knowledge towards offensive/defensive security under the branch of information technology (IT).

## Status

I'm currently studying for CCNP (ENCOR 350-401) Enterprise Networks and programming, then I'm planning on taking PWK afterward. CCNP is a professional level track for networking; a study on implementing core enterprise network technologies including dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) architecture, virtualization, infrastructure, network assurance, security, and automation. PWK on the other hand is a penetration testing training course designed for information security professionals; teaches web application security skills in Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation (AWAE), or wireless security skills in Offensive Security Wireless Attacks (WiFu). I'm also dedicated on contributing to open source projects which I will be posting here on GitHub.
